# HCH - Handy C Headers

Repository for my C headers which i made due to having a need of specific functionality like reading a file, having a length 
based string, or a tree data structure. 

Every header is self-contained and uses define macros to function.

- Every used or semi-tested headers are in `src` directory
- Everything unfinished and under development in `unfinished` directory
- Examples or tests of the headers are in `examples` directory
